        <h3 class="subhead">Biography</h3>
        <p>George Langford, not only an activist in pushing for equality and integration, but a lover of science. He himself says 
            that growing up on a farm spurred his interest in the subject due to the fact that he wanted to better understand nature 
            (FOCUS, n.d.). Throughout highschool he would be directed toward the sciences by a few great teachers, leading to his 
            eventual attendance at Fayetteville State University, where his professors would lead him into attending the Illinois 
            Institute of Technology for graduate school (FOCUS, n.d.). It was here that he met Tay Hayashi who pointed him into 
            the path of cell biology which spurred his later career pursuits and further advanced his neuroscience background. 
            Langford would receive both his masters and his PhD at the Illinois Institute of Technology and get his postdoc at the 
            University of Pennsylvania (FOCUS, n.d.). He would later work at the University of Massachusetts, Howard, be on the 
            faculty for the department of Physiology at UNC medical School, then at Dartmouth, UMass Amherst as a dean, and lastly 
            a dean at Syracuse University (FOCUS, n.d.). He is currently the Dean Emeritus of the College of Arts and Sciences at 
            Syracuse University (FOCUS, n.d.). He is a professor of Biology and a Distinguished Professor of Neuroscience Biology 
            and focuses his research on the actions of actin cytoskeleton in health and disease (FOCUS, n.d.). George Langford’s 
            wife is Sylvia Langford and together they have three children who were raised in North Carolina (FOCUS, n.d.).</p><br>
        <h3 class="subhead">Research</h3>
        <p>His research primarily focuses on the actions of actin cytoskeleton in health and disease. This topic of research 
            involves the study of the function of the actin cytoskeleton in a variety of areas, primarily in organelle/vesicle 
            transport in axons of nerve cells. In one of his many research papers, he conducted research on the “Transportation 
            of ER Vesicles on Actin Filaments in Neurons by Myosin V” (Tabb, Molyneaux, Cohen, Kuznetsov, & Langford, 1998). In 
            this paper, by showing that antibodies that were made to a peptide in the globular head fragment of Myosin V and in the 
            globular tail domain, inhibited vesicle transport on actin filaments, the conclusion that was reached was ER vesicles 
            are transported on actin filaments by myosin V (Tabb et al., 1998). Confirming that actin filaments were involved with 
            fast axonal transport (Tabb et al., 1998). 
            <br>
            The antibodies were used to show that myosin V activity is required for the transport of vesicles on actin filaments 
            and due to the matter that the myosin V inactivity caused an inhibition of vesicle transport on actin filaments, the 
            conclusion mentioned above could be logically justified (Tabb et al., 1998). His research is currently still ongoing 
            and continues to develop upon our current understanding.</p><br>
        <h3 class="subhead">Course connection</h3>
        <p>Referring to the sliding-filament model of sarcomere shortening (discussed in class), actin filaments come into play 
            (Bear, 2015). The sliding-filament model is the basis of muscle contraction, wherein actin (a thin filament protein) 
            interacts with myosin (a thick filament protein) to produce the excitation and contraction of muscles (Bear, 2015). 
            Actin is the major thin filament in skeletal muscle fibers and present in all cells as a cytoskeletal protein (Bear, 
            2015). Actin filaments also play a role in maintaining AMPAR-mediated transmission and enhancing it during long term 
            potentiation (LTP) (Bear, 2015). LTP is a strengthening of synapses that are frequently activated (Bear, 2015). LTP 
            is a basis in synaptic plasticity, a topic that deals with the ability of our synapses to change in strength due to 
            patterns of synaptic activity (Ber, 2015). Synaptic plasticity is linked to memory and learning (Bear, 2015). Memory 
            and learning are both topics that we also cover in Neuroscience 175, most recently with memory consolidation in the 
            brain as well as types of memories, such as explicit and implicit.</p>
