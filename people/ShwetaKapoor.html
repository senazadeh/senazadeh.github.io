        <h3 class="subhead">Biography</h3>
        <p>Shweta Kapoor is an assistant professor at Emory University. Her specificalized area is psychiatry and behavioral 
            sciences. Her interested areas are chronic pain, severe, and persistent mental illness. She has worked on and continues 
            to do research with those areas of interest with a specific emphasis on pain response. Kapoor started her work at the 
            Emory- Grady psychology internship program. She then continued her involvement with clinical research in her fellowship 
            year. She has earned her MBBS, done residency at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, residency at 
            Emory University School of Medicine, earned her PhD in clinical health psychology, and her postdoctoral fellowship in 
            clinical psychology. <br>
            Shweta Kappor was born in India. She speaks Hindi, Punjabi, and English. She earned her MBBS at Kasturba Medical College, 
            located in Manipal, India. Later, she finished her residency at the University of Texas at Houston, and at Emory 
            University School of Medicine, where she continued her involvement with clinical research. After she had completed her 
            residency, she earned a PhD from the University of Alabama. Currently, Kapoor is an assistant professor at Emory 
            University. </p><br>
        <h3 class="subhead">Research</h3>
        <p>Her specificalized area is psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Her interested areas are chronic pain, severe, and 
            persistent mental illness with emphasis on pain response. In one of her recent published research work, Kapoor and 
            her team investigated the interactive effect of the serotonin transporter genotype and drug use on suicidal behaviors 
            in patients with bipolar disorder, abbreviated as BD (Baylor College, n.d.). The results were: 1) Based on drug use, 
            the short and long allele had different effects. 2) for BD patients with little to no drug use, the short allele was 
            the risk of suicidal behavior. 3) for BD patients with a higher amount of drug use, the long allele was the risk for 
            suicidal behavior (Roane et al., 2019).</p><br>
        <h3 class="subhead">Course Connection</h3>
        <p>In NSCI 175, we talked about mental illness, specifically we talked about the affective disorders (depression and bipolar 
            disorder). Kapoorâ€™s recent work was emphasized on patients who were diagnosed with bipolar disorders. Her work also 
            contained information that we learned about the serotonin transporters. While we did not talk in-depth about the 
            serotonin transporters, however, we learned what serotonin is and its effect on our brains. </p>
